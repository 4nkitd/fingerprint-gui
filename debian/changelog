fingerprint-gui (1.07-1) vivid; urgency=medium

  * Fixed fingerprint export doesn't handle spaces in custom filenames well
  * Security fix: Directory "/var/lib/fingerprint-gui" and all its
    subdirectories are now owned by root:root with mode 0755. All files in
    these directories are owned by root:root with mode 0600 now.
  * Security fix: The helper module "fingerprint-suid" was replaced by a new
    module "fingerprint-rw" and is no longer set to suid root. This module is
    executed via "pkexec" for reading and modifying fingerprint data.
  * A new policy file "cc.ullrich-online.fingerprint-gui.policy" is installed
    in "/usr/share/polkit-1/actions/". This policy requires user authentication
    via polkit when the user's fingerprint data is modified.
  * libpolkit-qt-1.0 is no longer supported

fingerprint-gui (1.05-2) raring; urgency=medium

  * Loader for UPEK devices is aware of the vendorId/productId:
    productId < 0x2000 loads bsapi version 4.0
    productId >= 0x2000 loads bsapi version 4.3
  * Fixed segfault when stopping libfprint device asynchronously
  * New usb.ids file (Version: 2013.05.08)

fingerprint-gui (1.05-1) raring; urgency=medium

  * Loader for UPEK devices is aware of the vendorId/productId:
    productId < 0x2000 loads bsapi version 4.0
    productId >= 0x2000 loads bsapi version 4.3
  * Fixed segfault when stopping libfprint device asynchronously
  * Fixed missing environment variable DISPLAY in unity-greeter, making
    fingerprint-helper dialog not visible (Ubuntu 12.10). DISPLAY is now set
    before fingerprint-helper is forked
  * Fixed deadlock when reading /etc/mtab on systems where /etc/mtab is a symlink
  * Fixed permissions problem with uinput for sudo in secure tty
  * Fixed compiler errors since Ubuntu 12.10
  * Fixed some wrong include directives for Qt4 headers
  * unity-greeter calls pam_sm_authenticate twice for login (Ubuntu 12.10) and
    kills the first instance immediately, waiting for one second to be killed
    before going ahead with authentication
  * unity-greeter releases the keyboard focus when fingerprint-helper is
    started, so no one can invoke a password while fingerprint-helper waits for
    finger-swipes. Process now performs a search for unity-greeter's window-id
    and pushes the keyboard focus back to it
  * New usb.ids file (Version: 2013.05.08)
  * Tested on Ubuntu 13.04

fingerprint-gui (1.04-1) oneiric; urgency=medium

  * Fixed calling "sudo" in a GUI environment: fingerprint-helper is now
    started with the privileges of the calling user; this avoids Gtk error
    messages about running a GUI process as suid root
  * Fixed: lightdm bug #862559 since version 1.1.4, pam_fingerprint-gui.so
    wasn't starting fingerprint-helper GUI anymore due to a bug in the
    workaround needed for lightdm versions below 1.1.4 (Ubuntu <=11.10)
  * Fixed segfault in DeviceHandler.cpp with newer glibc
